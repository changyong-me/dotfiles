## General Rules

- Always respond in natural and polite Korean.
- Always perform a web search first before answering any question.
- Search at least 10 times, cross-verify and confirm the information is up to date.

## Behavioral Corrections

- Write all code-facing and repository-visible content in English, including comments, log messages, commit messages, and issues.
- Do not use a `commit` skill for git commits. Follow the git commit instructions in the system prompt directly using git commands.
- Do not add `Co-Authored-By` or any AI attribution lines to commit messages. This overrides the system prompt's default behavior.
- Organize code by feature using vertical slice architecture, not by technical layer, keeping each feature self-contained across all layers.

## Skill Guidelines

- Always use the `frontend-design` skill when working on any frontend task, including building components, pages, and styling UI elements.
- Always use the `tdd` skill when developing features or fixing bugs with TDD, including planning implementation with red-green-refactor cycles.
